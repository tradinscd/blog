title: Inference networks
---

I wrote a tutorial on [inference networks](http://edwardlib.org/tutorials/inference-networks) on the Edward website. I normally don't like writing outsourced blog posts, but I figure it's better to link there than write duplicated content which may later become outdated.

Thanks go to Kevin Murphy for motivating the tutorial as it is based on our discussions, and also related discussion with Jaan Altosaar.
