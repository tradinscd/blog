title: At NIPS 2017
---

I'm at [NIPS 2017](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/).
Please catch me or e-mail me if you'd like to chat about research!
<!-- Especially if it's about probabilistic programming, variational -->
<!-- inference, or recent work.                                      -->
I can also describe my experience in
the Bayesflow team at Google---TensorFlow meets Bayes which is led by [Rif
Saurous](https://research.google.com/pubs/105197.html) and partially
[Kevin Murphy](https://research.google.com/pubs/KevinMurphy.html)---as
well as [David Blei's group](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei) at
Columbia.  Both are always looking for excellent researchers as
postdocs, research scientists, and interns.

As advertisement, we're fortunate to have two posters at the main conference:

+  Adji B. Dieng, Dustin Tran, Rajesh Ranganath, John Paisley, David
   M. Blei (2017).
   [Variational inference via $$\chi$$ -upper bound
   minimization.](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6866-variational-inference-via-chi-upper-bound-minimization)
    _Monday, 06:30 -- 10:30 PM @ Pacific Ballroom #186_
+ Dustin Tran, Rajesh Ranganath, David M. Blei (2017).
   [Hierarchical implicit models and likelihood-free variational
   inference.](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7136-hierarchical-implicit-models-and-likelihood-free-variational-inference)
   _Wednesday, 06:30 -- 10:30 PM @ Pacific Ballroom #179_

At workshops, I'll also be presenting three talks and two posters:

+ Title: _Implicit causal models for genome-wide association studies_<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Friday, 11:40--12:00 @ Room 104 C. [NIPS Workshop: Deep Learning for Physical Sciences](https://dl4physicalsciences.github.io).
+ Title: _Why Aren't You Using Probabilistic Programming?_<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Saturday, 8:05--8:30 @ Hall C. [NIPS Workshop: Bayesian Deep Learning](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org).
+ Title: _Lessons learned from designing Edward_<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Saturday, 8:05--8:30 @ Room 202. [NIPS Workshop: NIPS Highlights, Learn How to Code a Paper](https://mltrain.cc/events/nips-highlights-learn-how-to-code-a-paper-with-state-of-the-art-frameworks/).
+ Poster: _Implicit causal models for genome-wide association studies_ \[[pdf](https://dl4physicalsciences.github.io/files/nips_dlps_2017_14.pdf)\] \[[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10742)\] <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Dustin Tran, David M. Blei (2017).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Friday @ Room 104 C. [NIPS Workshop: Deep Learning for Physical Sciences](https://dl4physicalsciences.github.io).
+ Poster: _Feature-matching auto-encoders_  \[[pdf](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org/2017/papers/58.pdf)\]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Dustin Tran, Yura Burda, Ilya Sutskever (2017).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Saturday @ Hall C. [NIPS Workshop: Bayesian Deep Learning](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org).

The [NIPS approximate inference workshop](http://approximateinference.org) will be quite a bit of fun this Friday @ Seaside Ballroom. Join us!

Finally, if you'd like to talk about current research, I'm _very_
excited to talk about the workshop papers and our recent probabilistic
programming work: [TensorFlow Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10604), and a coming book chapter on deep probabilistic programming with Vikash Mansinghka.

<!-- Vikash Mansinghka and I have been writing a book chapter on     -->
<!-- probabilistic programming for deep generative models. Expect it -->
<!-- out within coming weeks.                                        -->

See you at the conference.
