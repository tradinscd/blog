title: Video resources for machine learning (an update)
---

Last year I shared my collection of [video resources for
machine learning]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-01-03-video-resources-for-machine-learning %}). (I attribute a significant portion of my education to these videos.)

It was unwieldy taking individual e-mail requests and updating a
time-stamped blog post. So now it's a Github repo. [Enjoy.](https://github.com/dustinvtran/ml-videos)
