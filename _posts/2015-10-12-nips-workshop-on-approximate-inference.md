title: 'NIPS workshop on Approximate Inference: submit your papers!'
---

A [few of my colleagues in Columbia](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/), [Tamara Broderick](http://www.tamarabroderick.com), [Shakir Mohamed](http://www.shakirm.com), [Matt Hoffman](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mdhoffma/), and [Neil Lawrence](http://inverseprobability.com) are organizing a workshop on approximate (Bayesian) inference at NIPS this year. The Bayesian is implied! The deadline for abstract submissions is this Friday, October 16.

We were lucky to get an incredible list of invited speakers and panelists, as well as some travel funding. I'm really looking forward to the two panelsâ€”one on the practical usage of approximate inference, and the other on the foundational issues. Hoping it goes nearly as well as last year's workshop on variational inference.
