This is my first launch for a blog using a VPS. I've still not completely determined what would exist in these netherealms of the internet; in general, however, it would examine any current thoughts relevant to an activity I am doingâ€”whether that be statistical concepts, data science code tricks, machine learning tools, or even my hobbies in fiction and programming.

I love personal blogs and I love the ability to analyze topics and even jot down interesting ideas you've run across in an article format. I used to own a personal Wordpress blog for two years but dreaded the bloat and awkward functionality. Now with Ghost (and all the advantages of your own dedicated CMS compared to that of Medium's, Wordpress.com's, etc.), I'm excited to see how I'll take advantage of this.
